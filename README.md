## Super Fly WallPapers

An e-commerce platform to sell wall papers & wide format graphics targeted at streamers/ gamers as opposed to your standard baby nursery/ interior decor demographic.

### Purpose:

To offer wide format printing services to a more specific target demographic and in doing so, scaling back my business to a point where I can ship graphics instead of having to perform site measures and installs. The quoting calculator will allow the customer to perform their own measurements and the fact that I'll be shipping only means graphics will be rolled up for customer to DIY or sub-contract an external installer.

To create and deploy a full stack application/ e-commerce website using the MERN stack. Fully functioning backend API that will allow customers to register as users, browse, rate & favourite wall-paper designs. Ultimately affording them the opportunity to order, pay for and have shipped wide format graphics and wall papers. Quoting calculator highly desirable as well as ai image generation would be nice to have.
